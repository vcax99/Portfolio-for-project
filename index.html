            <p>
              With the rise of the Taliban in Afghanistan, the people and the
              country's economy have suffered in various ways as the war
              affected Afghanistan's civil conflict. Therefore, the economy of
              the country has shrunk by 20% to 30% from late 2021 as a
              consequence of this, the people of Afghanistan have lost their
              jobs, especially women, and the war with the Taliban community has
              distorted their social life. Moreover, hundreds of thousands of
              people have left the country and social service has been decimated
              in this way, the Taliban war affects the economy of the country.

              The reflection paper is based on the crisis in Afghanistan after
              the war and its effects on the economy of the country. A detailed
              analysis of the crisis after the war will be discussed to
              understand the consequences of the war on the economy of the
              country by using the framework. In addition to this, to develop
              and evaluate the crisis, a reflection of the findings will be
              given to analyze the outcomes of the study in a particular way.
              Furthermore, recommendations will be suggested by the SMART
              framework as it will help to give specific, measurable,
              actionable, relevant, and time-related suggestions for developing
              the economy of the country. In addition to this, the Secondary
              data analysis will be done to complete the detailed process of
              findings and the collection of raw materials will be highlighted
              to get a brief idea of the findings process in an effective way.

        <h2 class="p-2">Analysis of the crisis</h2>
        The victory of the Taliban has caused conflicts in the security measures
        of Afghanistan that invaded the economy of the country. The crisis
        affected politics, increased food security, and further widespread
        deprivation that reduced consumption and shrunk household incomes that
        caused sudden cessation of aid which led to a drop in aggregate demand.
        Afghanistan's financial status and its central bank also known as
        Afghanistan Bank lost its ability to manage the systems of payments and
        conducted monetary policies that freeze the assets further resulting in
        a shortage of printing new currency notes in Afghanistan (Omar and
        Tyagi, 2021). The resumption of the economy remained on budget and the
        international community during the year of war helped Afghanistan tackle
        the challenges that were imposed by the Taliban. The country was going
        through a huge debt and was bound to use a few models that helped to
        grow its assets and become financially stable.

            <h4>Financial Liberalisation and over borrowing</h4>
            <p>
              The model was introduced by McKinnon along with his former student
              Huw Pill, to stabilize the factor of inflation that was affected
              by the war and perform multiple functional activities to improve
              the economic indicator such as exchange rate, domestic collection
              of revenue, and increment in exports. The argument mentions the
              opening of the financial sector that impacts the domestic banking
              sector and removes the problem of hazardous situations. According
              to Kuzmanet al. (2022), the statistics of Afghanistan and its
              preliminary official status showed a percentage of 20.7 in 2021
              due to the effects of war. The functions of banks are reliant on
              government taxes and high inflation rates and reserve ratios
              produce a gap that impacts lending and deposit procedures
              including interests. The reduction led to 20-30% in August 2021
              which resulted in the loss of jobs and impacted the common living
              and poverty, the bills were found to suffer from the liquidity
              crisis and the shortage of the bank notes were raising the
              problem. The economic structure of Afghanistan was 75% dependent
              on foreign countries, which increases the risk of over borrowing
              and bad debts which cannot be paid in the meantime (Benigno et al.
              2022). When the Taliban took over the country the World Bank was
              instructed to cut around 2 billion in international assistance for
              the payment of salaries to the workers and cover the expenses
              through projected funds imposed by the international development
              association also known as IDA.

            <h4>First and second-generation models of currency crisis</h4>
            <p>
              The construction of the first generation for the currency crisis
              was initiated with an idea that is simple to assume the factors
              which are wrong with the economic fundamentals such as policy
              inconsistency that are adopted during the fixed exchange rate, for
              example, an increase in monetary growth. The second generation of
              the model for the currency crisis is a policy that is not
              effective for protection from the attacks of high inflation or
              reduced GDP and therefore, is based on the reaction of the
              functional activities of the bank. The Afghanistan government's
              major aim was to pursue two goals that included a fixed exchange
              rate and reducing the element of unemployment along with the
              low-interest rates, payment of bad debts, and protection of the
              economy of the country. Opinion of Islam, (2022) stated that the
              war worsens the situation which resulted in 500,000 job losses and
              the unemployment rate increased by 11.22% in 2019 which affected
              the market policies. The bigger attack came when the currency was
              not available and due to such a crisis, the maintenance of the
              exchange rate was high and costly which caused major instability
              in the economy and achieving the goals of the domestic nation. The
              motive of the first-generation model is to identify the problem of
              the crisis whereas the second generation provides validity and
              points that can be used for the inheritance of the instabilities.
              The implication of both the first and second-generation models
              relates to the different types of policies that impact the private
              sector as well as help the economy to stabilize.

            <h2 class="p-2">Reflection</h2>
            <p>The war began in 2001 and was the primary reason behind the triggering of incidents 
                that caused conflicts in Afghanistan therefore, consisted of three phrases. The war 
                came into focus on September 11 as the first phase of the conflict was the toppling 
                of the Taliban that aimed at ultra conservation of the factors related to political
                 forms that were ruling over Afghanistan (Niu, and Huang, 2022). The second phase 
                 began in 2002 and continued till 2008, which further included the strategies of the US to defeat the army of the Taliban and restore the economy of the Afghan state. The third phase started to take a turn that classifies into counterinsurgency for the enlargement of the forces to end the war and make decisions that protected the population. The livelihood of the country's people has been affected by the crisis of the economy after the war in Afghanistan (Hafner,  et al.2020). Moving to a low growth path the country for two years has come with zero improvements in per capita income. For this reason, poverty has been expected to remain in the country after the war in Afghanistan. In my opinion, the additional significant risk to the economy in Afghanistan is to continue the restrictive policies in women's education, work, and children's education. As mentioned by Pattanaik (2020),
                 the increase in instability of the government, and private banking sector in 
                Afghanistan has effects on the economy of the country as the potential reduction 
                from the international community worsened the security and political situation of
                 the country.  According to the report, the real GDP in 2022 has accumulated to a 
                 contraction of close to 30% to 35% between 2021 and 2022 (Worldbank.org, 2022).
                 Preliminary statistics of the GDP have been slowed down as it shows the resumptions
                  of the off-budget international budget help to mitigate some of the negative 
                  impact of the economy from the humanitarian background. In the meantime in 2020, 
                  the GDP rate of the country has decreased and it affects the likelihood of the 
                  country and the faced economical deduction by the war crisis in the country. The 
                  above graph shows the growth rate of the country in gross domestic products, which is nearly -2.35% (Statista.com, 2022). Moreover, the report has suggested that Afghanistan holds a smaller economical position in the world economy, and the economy of the country has reached an inflection point that is plateauing around a low level of equilibrium. As per the report, the inflation rate of the country averaged 6.66% in 2022 and it had reached -18.37% in 2009 after facing the Taliban war in the country and it affects the economy of the country in a particular way (Statista.com, 2022). On the other hand, Harima, (2022) has stated that whenever the inflation 
                rate has been high some of the indicators of the country have increased such as 
                exchange rate volatility reduced in the country, and domestic revenue collection 
                becomes relatively healthy and adjustable. However, the people of the county have suffered especially the majority of the poor people in the country whereas six percent of the people have been classified as “struggling” while zero percent rated their life to cross into the “thriving” subsection of the country (Islam et al. 2022). Therefore, it can be stated that the Afghanistan people have been experiencing suffering that is on an unpredicted scale of the measurement. As per the statement of He, and Feng (2022), the Taliban fuelled violence increased and oversized the control of the country and the control of the economy of the country in a particular way. The economy of the country suffered after the Taliban attacked the country as the monopoly of this community variously affects the banking sectors of the country in the same way it affects the people of the country. </p>

          <p class="card-text">For the first time in twenty years, the Taliban are in charge of Afghanistan. They no longer face armed opposition, but they now have an economy that is on the verge of collapse, which has the potential to exacerbate an already dire humanitarian disaster. The economy already lacked a strong foundation and was largely dependent on handouts. When foreign help accounts for 10% or more of a country's GDP, that country is said to be aid-dependent; the World Bank estimates that international aid accounted for roughly 40% of Afghanistan's GDP (Bbc, 2022). Western nations, including the United States and Germany, halted foreign aid to Afghanistan when it became evident that the Taliban would take over Kabul. In this situation, in my opinion, they have to stay strong and have to bond with another neighbouring country, from where they get help to face the problem. Since then, payments have also been suspended by the IMF and the World Bank. The “central bank of Afghanistan, Afghanistan Bank (DAB)”, has also frozen its foreign deposits. At this time, the specific goal of this country will be unity which is to give more power to fight against the situation. </p>

          <p class="card-text">The specific goal can be achieved with the help of unity and a strong mentality. In addition to the high cost of gas, closed banks, lack basic foodstuffs in Kabul stores, and inability to find cell top-ups, people are also in fear for their lives (Rescue, 2022). Humanitarian aid cannot fix Afghanistan's humanitarian crisis on its own. To lift Afghans out of poverty, Afghanistan's economy must be upgraded. But to improve Afghanistan's economy, the International community must communicate with the Taliban. </p>

Additionally, people must provide displaced families with food, clothing, shelter, clean water, sanitation, and other requirements (Rescue, 2022). They must also establish secure learning environments and provide community-based teaching, among other services. In my opinion, if individuals spread awareness and make a small charity to gather all the funds and things then it will be very effective for the people of Afghanistan.  </p>

<div class="container border_container_solid2 mt-5" >
    <p>In the attack of the Taliban, The United States went to wage a necessary war of self-defence as the rescue team of the US planned to prevent the execution of the horrifying plan of the Taliban. It has been observed that the US government's efforts to save the people of Afghanistan from the attack and the contribution of the US are huge on the economy of the country. In addition to this, the United States has exported $2.22 million and imported $682k from Afghanistan and which resulted in a positive state in the country and increased the trade balance that is nearly $1.54 million. Additionally, it can be stated that the funding of the US helps the country to increase its economy of the country from its downfall. Moreover, the United States supports the country by providing more than $1.1 billion in funding. It can be summarized that the United States has shown its humanitarian background through the past war. In the present scenario, Afghanistan is controlled by the Taliban community, and the economy of the country is running a downturn that can also affect the world economy. Hence, many countries have stopped exporting and importing from Afghanistan, which also creates a huge risk in the country.</p>
